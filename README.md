# SVG Logo Maker
A node.js app that takes inputs and creates a custom logo.

## Description
This is a command-line application that accepts user input.<br>
When you are prompted for text you can enter up to three characters.<br>
When you are prompted for the text color you can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).<br>
When you are prompted for a shape you are presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.<br>
When you are prompted for the shape's color you can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).<br>
When you have entered input for all the prompts an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` and the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.<br>
When you open the `logo.svg` file in a browser you are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria you entered.<br>
